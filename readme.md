# what it feels like

![snapshot of a monochrome pixel landscape](snapshot.gif "what it feels like in here")

A [bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) sketch (I'm not sure I can call it a game, really!) playable [here](https://deerful.itch.io/what-it-feels-like-in-here).

Includes plaintext gamedata and html template with embedded audio. 

Nothing particularly elaborate, but if you want to hack around in it for some reason, here it is.
